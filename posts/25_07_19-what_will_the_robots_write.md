title: "What will the robots write"
---

I've decided to start writing about my projects. This is the first post, so it's about the website it's posted on. It's a simple markdown file based site I built yesterday with Kotlin and Ktor. This is the first time I've used Kotlin, my usual go to language is Elixir, I've been learning Rust, and I use Python/TypeScript where necessary. Recently I've been thinking about what languages are best for generative software development. The characteristics I've come up with are ecosystem, garbage collected, strong static types, and readable. I want that when the generated code compiles that it holds certain invariants and won't break my application. I also need to be able to jump in and understand large amounts of generated code when it's gone off the rails. Testing is useful  but the agent is also writing the tests and you have to review them to see if they are useful. However if you define some abstractions in the core that you know the compiler is going to enforce, and those files haven't changed you can rely on that to a certain extent. For this reason I am learning Kotlin, if I was smarter or not in the loop then I would think to use Scala or Haskell. I still plan to use Elixir and Rust for their strengths but as a default backend language I am starting here with my personal software. My prediction is that I will be deleting more code than I write by the end of the year.
