title: Crossroads
---

The summer has come to a close, and reflecting back on this year, much of my work was exploratory, leading to many new projects. I'm happy with most of them, but now I want to commit to a select few to complete and iterate on for the rest of the year. The goal is to enter the new year ready to go all-in on a focused venture.

I'll be focusing my efforts on two key themes:

- AI-enabled apps with feedback loops
- Sim-to-real for drones

Here are the projects I'm prioritizing to complete:

- Replicant: LLM inference coordination server
- Rager: LLM workflow library
- Rager Cloud: logging/feedback server for Rager
- Flywheel: coding agent
- Toyspired: prompt/image to 3D print mailed to you
- Hane: sim-to-real for drones

The default setup uses GitHub hosting with GitHub Actions for CI/CD deployed to AWS EKS, CDKTF with TypeScript for infrastructure as code, Aurora serverless Postgres with PGVector for the database, and a stack of Elixir with Kotlin, Rust, TypeScript, and Python where needed.
