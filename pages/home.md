Hello! I'm Marko Vukovic ([**mvkvc**](https://github.com/mvkvc)), a full-stack software developer based in Toronto, Canada. I spend most of my time building things with Elixir by default but I also work with Rust, Kotlin, Python, and TypeScript. Lately I've been focused on using AI to build applications that improve through feedback loops. This site is where I write about my projects and experiments.
