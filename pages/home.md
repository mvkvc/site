My name is Marko Vukovic ([**mvkvc**](https://github.com/mvkvc)), a full-stack developer based in Canada and Serbia. I specialize in the web platform and the BEAM ecosystem, with a focus on using AI to build applications that learn and adapt. I primarily work with Elixir, but also leverage Rust, Kotlin, Python, and TypeScript, and I try to use Postgres for everything. I'm available for contract work and am interested in collaborating on the types of projects I discuss on this site. You can view my resume [**here**](/static/resume.pdf). If anything here interests you, please feel free to reach out at [**mail@mvk.vc**](mailto:mail@mvk.vc).
